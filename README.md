# Password Reset Example Application written in Flask 

This is a simple and very basic application written in Python (Flask framework) that is meant
to show how to implement the functionality of password reset feature that is commonly used 
across web (and other) applications.

It is heavily influenced by Miguel Grinberg's [The Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).
If you are working with Flask and haven't stumbled across Miguel's blog go ahead and check it out
right away. He has a lot of stuff on Flask and his Mega-Tutorial is definitely one of the best
places to learn Flask.


## Features of the app
As already mentioned, this is very basic app with no fancy frontend, just Python (Flask) and some 
HTML. It's sole purpose is to showcase one idea how to implement password reset flow in Flask.

### Pages in the app:
- Home page - empty page with list of links to other pages
- Registration page
- Login page
- Protected page - page that is only visible to logged-in users
- Password reset (and create new password) page
